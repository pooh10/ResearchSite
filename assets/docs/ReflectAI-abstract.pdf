ReflectAI: AI-Assisted Journaling for Emotional Awareness

Abstract

This research explores the potential of AI-assisted journaling to support emotional awareness and reflective practice. We developed a prototype application that provides contextual prompts and analysis to help users overcome blank-page anxiety and engage in deeper self-reflection.

Methodology: A longitudinal study with 6 participants over 10-14 days, measuring usage patterns, emotional awareness scores, and qualitative feedback.

Results: Participants showed improved emotional awareness (average increase of 1.5 points on 5-point scale) and reported reduced anxiety about journaling. The AI prompts were particularly effective in encouraging deeper "why" and "so-what" reflection.

Implications: AI-assisted journaling shows promise for supporting consistent reflective practice and emotional growth, particularly for users who struggle with traditional journaling approaches.

Keywords: AI-assisted journaling, emotional awareness, reflective practice, user experience, mental health technology
